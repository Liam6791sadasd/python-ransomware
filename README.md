# python-ransomware
Python Ransomware, it's somewhat simple... BUT I'll add a description because why not

So, you may be wondering... "What does it do?"

Well, it's ransomware. it encrypts all your files.

It does take some time to encrypt, so sorry. Takes around 60+ Seconds depending on the amount of files. Can take up to 5-10 minutes even. 

Decryption is free, of course. You wait for it to stop encrypting, once it pops up the .txt file, you can choose whether you want to decrypt or not.




**You may be wondering.. What does it include?**

- Free decryption
- Adds to startup
- Restarts PC
- Bypasses UAC (User Account Control)
- Bypasses Windows Defender (soon to be tested w/ malwarebytes premium)
- Detects and bypasses VM's (dunno if it works)
- Adds itself to the registry
- Free decryption


***Known Bugs:***

- Doesn't always stop user input
- Slow lol
