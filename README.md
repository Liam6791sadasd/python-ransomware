# python-ransomware
Python Ransomware, it's somewhat simple... BUT I'll add a description because why not

***Huge thanks to https://github.com/Senc3951! Great guy***


So, you may be wondering... "What does it do?"

Well, it's ransomware. it encrypts all your files.

It does take some time to encrypt, so sorry. Takes around 60+ Seconds depending on the amount of files. Can take up to 5-10 minutes even. 

Decryption is free, of course. You wait for it to stop encrypting, once it pops up the .txt file, you can choose whether you want to decrypt or not.




**You may be wondering.. What does it include?**

- Free decryption
- Adds to startup
- Restarts PC
- Bypasses UAC (User Account Control)
- Bypasses Windows Defender (soon to be tested w/ malwarebytes premium)
- Detects and bypasses VM's (dunno if it works)
- Adds itself to the registry
- Free decryption


***Known Bugs:***

- Doesn't always stop user input
- Slow lol

`How to install?`

Download all necessary imports (found in the files, too lazy to add a txt file with all of them)
Make sure Python is installed (3.7+ I think)
CD into the files directory
python3 main.py

***OR***

pyinstaller -F main.py

if you want to compile into an exe^
